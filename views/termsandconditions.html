                                    <h3>1. Bookings</h3>
        <p>1.1 We facilitate the processing and booking of accommodation and other travel services (the "<strong>travel services</strong>"). We do not provide, own or run any travel services ourselves and in particular we do not provide, own or run any accommodation.</p>
        <p>1.2 You confirm that you are of sufficient age to use the Bmyraahi Sites lawfully, enter into a contract and to create binding legal obligations for any liability you may incur as a result of the use of the Bmyraahi Sites. You understand that you are financially responsible for all uses of the Bmyraahi Sites by you and those using your log-in information.</p>
        <p>1.3 When you make a booking using the Bmyraahi Sites, you agree to enter into a contract for travel services and your contract for travel services (including accommodation) is with the travel services provider, not Bmyraahi, as we are only acting as agent for the travel services provider. It is the travel services provider's responsibility to provide you with the travel services. We are not responsible for the fulfilment of any booking made through the Bmyraahi Sites or for the quality of any accommodation or any other travel services that are booked.</p>
        <p>1.4 Please note that all bookings are subject to the booking conditions displayed to you prior to you confirming your booking (the “<strong>Booking Conditions</strong>”).</p>
                                    <h3>2. Making and Cancelling a Booking</h3>
        <p>2.1 On making a booking, you will be required to pay a non-refundable deposit (being a part payment towards the total value of your booking) which will always be non-refundable unless the Standard Flexible Booking option is available and you choose to select it, in which case the deposit will be credited back to your account if you cancel your booking in certain circumstances (see below for more details). We collect this deposit for and on behalf of the relevant travel services provider.</p>
        <p>You may also be required to pay a flat booking fee, which is our fee for making the booking. Where we charge a booking fee, it is non-refundable in all circumstances.</p>
        <p>Save as set out in the Booking Conditions, or the travel service provider’s terms and conditions, you will be responsible to the travel services provider on arrival for payment of the balance of the cost of the booking made by you, together with any other payments for any additional services subsequently agreed with the travel services provider and, where applicable, payment of the travel services provider's service charges and taxes, pursuant to the terms and conditions of trade applied by such travel services provider.</p>
        <p>2.2 You must use a credit card or debit card to guarantee a booking. By making a booking with your credit card or debit card, you agree to accept the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of the travel services provider as set out in its terms and conditions. In the event that you cancel your booking outside the permitted timeframe specified in the travel service provider’s terms and conditions (or you fail to arrive by your agreed check-in time), you authorise the travel services provider to charge to your credit card or debit card without further reference to you an amount not exceeding the charge for one night's stay (in the case of accommodation) or such other amount as may be set out in the travel service provider's terms and conditions.  Please note that there will be no additional charges for cancellations or no-shows in respect of Non-Refundable Bookings, but you will not be refunded the cost of any part of your booking in such circumstances. </p>
        <p>2.3 Your non-arrival by the agreed check-in time may result in the cancellation of your entire booking. Any amendments to your booking must be notified to and agreed with the travel services provider directly (but no refund of all or any part of the deposit will be made). Please note it is not possible to amend Non-Refundable Bookings.  In making a booking, it shall be your responsibility to disclose to the travel services provider any requirements or special facilities that you or a member of your party may need as a result of any medical conditions.</p>
        <p>2.4 When a booking is confirmed we will issue the booking confirmation on behalf of the travel services provider for each booking, but will not provide information about any charges for additional services.  We will endeavour to ensure that the booking confirmation includes details of all taxes charged by the travel services provider, in relation to which please see clause 8.9 below. We strongly recommend you check and confirm with the travel services provider the precise terms and conditions upon which the travel services provider makes the reserved service available to you upon receipt of the booking confirmation. The reference numbers included on the booking confirmation should be quoted in all enquiries, cancellation or modification of the booking.</p>
        <p>2.5 You may cancel your booking in accordance with the cancellation policy of the provider as disclosed on the booking confirmation and detailed property description page; this is normally at least 24 hours before your agreed check-in date. Please cancel by accessing the cancellation function available on the Bmyraahi Sites.</p>
        <p>2.6 If you choose the Standard Flexible Booking option when making your booking (where it is available) you will be charged a small fee and, in return, if you later decide to cancel your booking, your deposit will be credited back to your Bmyraahi account in US Dollars (provided you have given the period of notice required by the travel services provider, for which please see its terms) and you will be able to re-use that credit amount for future bookings on our site for a period of 6 months on and from the cancellation date. Where you originally paid your deposit in a currency other than US Dollars, we will convert the booking deposit amount into US Dollars using Bmyraahi’s standard exchange rates for the purpose of crediting it to your Bmyraahi account.  Your booking fee is non-refundable.</p>
        <p>2.7 If your booking is not a Non-Refundable Booking, and you selected neither the Standard Flexible Booking option nor the Non-Flexible Booking option, or the Standard Flexible Booking option is not available, your booking will automatically be deemed a Non-Flexible Booking.</p>
        <p>2.8 If you make a Non-Flexible Booking and you cancel your booking then, regardless of how much notice you give, deposits and booking fees will be non-refundable. Non-flexible booking customers should note that, even though your deposit and booking fee will be non-refundable in any event, you must give the amount of notice stipulated by the travel services provider in its cancellation policy, in order to avoid being charged an additional payment for a "no show" (see clause 2.2 above).</p>
        <p>2.9 Where you select Standard Flexible Booking (where it is available) for your booking, the following provisions will apply:</p>
        <p>(a) Your deposit will only be credited back where:</p>
        <p>(i) you have given the amount of notice for your cancellation that is required by the travel services provider in its Terms and Conditions and, in any event, you have given no less than 24 hours' notice prior to the scheduled check-in date;</p>
        <p>(ii) you have processed your cancellation online through the cancellation function available on the Bmyraahi Sites; and</p>
        <p>(iii) you have cancelled your full booking (partial cancellations, such as cancellations of 1 night of a 2-night stay, are not protected by cancellation protection).</p>
        <p>(b) Your cancellation credit will be applied to the account which is linked in our records to the email address that was used to process the initial booking. Credit cannot be applied to an account that does not relate to the booking email address.</p>
        <p>(c) Cancellation credit must be used within 6 months of the cancellation date, after which it is forfeited. Credit will not be applied to your account in respect of cancellations made by telephone or email.</p>
        <p>(d) In order to use your cancellation credit, simply go to Bmyraahi.com and make a booking using the same email address. Your credit will be automatically applied to your booking once you confirm the reservation.</p>
        <p>(e) Credit may only be used once. Where you cancel any subsequent bookings, you must have selected the Standard Flexible Booking option for those bookings in order for your deposit(s) to be protected and credited back to your account.</p>
        <p>(f) Cancellation credit only applies to deposits for accommodation bookings; it cannot be used in respect of other charges levied via the Bmyraahi Sites - e.g. booking fees or other purchases.</p>
        <p>(g) In the event of a no-show without cancellation (or where insufficient notice is given of a cancellation in accordance with these and/or the travel services provider's terms and conditions) all deposits, including deposits paid through the Standard Flexible Booking option, will be non-refundable and the travel services provider will have the right to charge your credit card on the basis set out in clause 2.2. (above).</p>
        <p>2.10 The deposit and the booking fee that you pay will be payable in the currency that you select as your "settlement currency" when making your booking. Where the accommodation price was uploaded by the travel services provider in a different currency, the deposit amount that you will be charged in your settlement currency will be calculated by converting the deposit price into your settlement currency using Bmyraahi’s standard exchange rates.</p>
                                    <h3>3. Liability and Disclaimers</h3>
        <p>3.1 In the event of a problem arising with your accommodation or other travel services, you should contact the travel services provider. If you have a problem with the booking that you have made via the Bmyraahi Sites please contact us directly via customerservice@Bmyraahi.com.</p>
        <p>3.2 We are acting solely as agent on behalf of the travel service provider and, as such, we are not a party to the contract between you and the travel services provider for the provision of travel services (including accommodation) and we have no responsibility or liability to you in respect of the terms of that contract. For example, we are not responsible for:</p>

        <p>3.3 Neither we nor any of our directors, employees, affiliates or other representatives will be liable to you (or any member of your corporate group, your affiliates or any other person or party who has an interest in the booking) for: (i) indirect, punitive, special or consequential loss or damages, (ii) loss of data, income, profits, business, opportunity, reputation, goodwill or (iii) loss of or damage to property, in each case arising out of or in connection with the use of any information, products, services, facilities and/or the materials offered through the Bmyraahi Sites, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such loss or damage, or such loss or damages were reasonably foreseeable.</p>
        <p>3.4 Our maximum aggregate liability to you (and any other party that has an interest in the booking) in relation to any booking made through us (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) shall be limited solely to the value of the booking fee that has been paid for that booking. Prior to making a booking, you should ensure that you have reviewed the travel services provider's terms and conditions and that they are acceptable to you.</p>

        <p>6.2 We accept no responsibility and are not liable for any Content of any
        kind that is posted, stored or uploaded by you or any third party on the Bmyraahi

        <p>6.3 Any use of the User Generated Content Features or other portions of the

        among other things, termination or suspension of your access to the User
        Generated Content Features and/or the Bmyraahi Sites. In order to comply
        with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to protect our systems or
        users of the Bmyraahi Sites, we may process and disclose any information
        held by us in relation to a user of the Bmyraahi Sites who posts or uploads
        inappropriate or objectionable Content including, without limitation, their
        name, email address, IP address, usage history, and posted Content. </p>
        <p>6.4 By posting or distributing Content to or through the Bmyraahi Sites,
        unless we indicate otherwise, you:</p>
        <p>(a) grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, transferable, irrevocable

                                    <h3>7. Reviews</h3>
        <p>7.1 You may be asked to review the travel services that you have received.
        We appreciate all feedback, but please note that the travel services provider
        in question will have access to your review so that they can act on your
        feedback and make any necessary improvements. The travel services providers
        will have your contact details and may contact you to ask further questions
        about your experiences in order to help them to make further improvements.</p>
                                    <h3>8. General</h3>
        <p>8.1 These Terms are drafted in the English language. If these
        Terms are translated into any other language, the English language version
        shall prevail</p>
        <p>8.2 Our failure to enforce at any time or for any period any one or more of
        the Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of them or the rights attaching to
        any of them.</p>
        <p>8.3 The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Bmyraahi in
        relation to the subject matter of these Terms and supersedes any previous
        agreements or representations between the parties relating to the subject
        matter of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>8.4 We reserve the right to change these Terms as well as the contents of the
        Bmyraahi Sites for any reason and without liability to you, any other user
        or any third party. This right shall not affect the Terms accepted by you upon
        making a legitimate booking or purchase using the Bmyraahi Sites. You should
        check these Terms for any changes each time you access the Bmyraahi Sites.</p>
        <p>8.5 These Terms and your use of the Bmyraahi Sites are governed by the
        laws of Ireland. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish
        courts in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Bmyraahi
        Sites each time you access the Bmyraahi Sites. Use of the Bmyraahi Sites
        is not authorised in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions
        of these Terms including, without limitation, this clause. </p>
        <p>8.6 Our performance of these Terms is subject to existing laws and legal
        process and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of our right
        to comply with law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of
        the Bmyraahi Sites or information provided to or gathered by us with respect
        to such use. </p>
        <p>8.7 If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable,
        then the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed to be superseded by
        any such valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of
        the original provision and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in
        effect. </p>
        <p>8.8 Although we cannot monitor the conduct of our users offsite, it shall be
        a breach of these Terms to use any information obtained from the Bmyraahi Sites
        in order to harass, abuse or harm other persons, or in order to contact,
        advertise to, solicit or sell to any user or person without their prior express
        consent. </p>
        <p>8.9 While our terms require that travel services providers display prices
        which are inclusive of all value added and other additional taxes, the price
        displayed is ultimately the responsibility of the travel services provider
        rather than ours. You acknowledge that we shall not have liability to you in
        respect of any attempt by travel services provider to levy additional value
        added or other taxes on you at the point of payment as a supplement to the
        price displayed and your sole recourse in this regard will be against the
        travel services provider.</p>
